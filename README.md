# PySocketServerCMD


Please download the files on both computers.

This socket is made to send a file from the client to the server. Like this you can avoid the user of USB keys.

Please make sure both computers are connected to the same network and be aware that if it is an enterprise or school network the socket could not work due to the use of proxy and firewalls
